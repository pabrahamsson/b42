== Introduction
With the recenly released https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-31/[Fedora 31] it was time to do another upgrade.

== Performing the upgrade
Again, the instructions from the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/updates-upgrades-rollbacks/#upgrading[documentation] are very simple and straightforward.
[source,shell]
----
$ sudo ostree remote gpg-import fedora -k /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora-30-primary
$ rpm-ostree rebase fedora:fedora/30/x86_64/silverblue
----
This took a few minutes and depends on your internet speed. Once these commands finish you'll be told to run `systemctl reboot`. This will reboot your system and when the Grub menu comes up, Fedora 31 should be the default. +
Profit and enjoy Fedora 31!!

== Toolbox issue
After successfully upgrading I tried to hop into one of my https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/toolbox/[Toolbox] containers.
[source,shell]
----
$ toolbox enter
toolbox: unable to migrate containers: Podman version couldn't be read
----
After reaching out to some members of the Silverblue team I was given the following suggestion:

I suspect you may have a stale libpod.conf file that could be causing issues w/ the default crun in F31
----
So I tried the following
[source,shell]
----
$ mv ~/.config/containers/libpod.conf /tmp
----
Now I was able to hop into my Toolbox container again (and a new libpod.conf file was automatically generated).

== Finish up
Kudos to the Silverblue Team for another great release.
